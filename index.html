            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a type of version control system (VCS) that is an open source distributed version control system that tracks changes in computer files and allows multiple people to collaborate on those files. Git has three main states that a users’ file can reside in: committed, modified, and staged. Git has a complete history of when files were updated and whom they were updated by. All users have a copy of the data stored on their local device and can work on it from their machine. This allows for the process to run much faster. Git is desirable by teams and developers because it is secure, flexible, and functional. Since Git is designed for both small and large projects, this makes it suitable for numerous kinds of workflow. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system (VCS) is a system that records changes in files. They keep track of who changed the file, when they changed the file, and what changes were made. It also allows the developer to convert the file back to a previous version of the file. This is an ideal program to use if you would like to see a file or project change over time. Version control systems allow no files to be overwritten. Individuals can work on the same file at the same time without clash. VCS also backs up your files so you do not lose your work. This means that if you mess up a file or lose it, you can easily recover it if needed. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are several different Git commands and their descriptions that are essential to know when using Git.  One command ‘git init,’ initializes a git repository. This command creates the initial ‘.git’ directory in a new or existing project. Another command, ‘git add,’ adds files changes in your working directory  to your index. ‘Git status’ shows the user the status of files in the index versus the working directory. Lastly, ‘git pull’ retrieves the files from the remote repository and merges it with your local one. ‘Git push’ pushes all the modified local objects to the remote repository and advances its branches.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is a central location where data is stored and managed. When a repository is created with files and directories, developers can document their change in history and track their status and versions. A remote repository is a repository that inhabits on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members. To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how to manage a remote repository. A remote repository of your project can be hosted on the Internet or a network. You can see which remote servers you have configured and you can run the remote with a command. When you have a project at a point that you wan to share it, you have to ‘push it.’ </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is a repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user. You can create a local repository one of two ways. One way is to create a brand new repository or you can also clone an existing remote repository onto your local machine. One reason Git is so fast compared to other tools is because all changes are made locally on and individuals device rather that on a remote server. Since the individual has a complete copy of all the files from the remote server, they can make changes without needing to be connected to the remote network. This also means that if anything were to go wrong, that all other members would still have a copy of the files, meaning the files could be easily restored. </p>
