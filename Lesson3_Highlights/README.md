## Assignment Date:  
June 2, 2017

## Student Name:  
Sara Beeler

## Project Description:
This assignment was laid out very similar to the last one, with a couple of additional steps. I set up a Github account, linked it to my Cloud9 account and edited multiple files in my lesson3 highlights folder. I also gained insight on several new and interesting topics that I had not previously heard of before.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned what a version control system is and how it stores and records the history of all its files including when they were updated and by whom.
2. I learned that Git is an open source distributed version control system that generally, only adds data, and you cannot change a file in Git without Git knowing about it.
3. I learned the difference between a local and remote repository. A remote repository is basically a server and a local repository is an individuals personal device.
